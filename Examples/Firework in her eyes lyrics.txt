Summer night, the lanterns glow,
I walk beside the river’s flow.
Your voice drifts softly through the crowd,
A quiet comfort in the loud.
My heartbeat flickers like the lights,
Painting memories in the night—
You turn to me with shy surprise,
And I see fireworks in your eyes.
Colors bloom in the sky above,
Like every whisper of your love—
And even if the night should fade,
This feeling somehow stays.
Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
But none outshine the sight of you.
The world is spinning soft and slow,
In every breeze, in every glow.
Hold my hand, don’t let it fly—
Like a dream passing by—
Tonight, I see the truth disguised:
There are fireworks in your eyes.
Your yukata of summer blue,
A flower dancing as you move.
The pinwheel turns with every breeze,
A wish carried across the trees.
I brush a stray hair from your face,
The moment stops, the world erased—
Just you and I beneath the sky,
And all the lights that burn so high.
Even when the sparks all die,
The warmth stays glowing in the sky—
And in my heart, where shadows fall,
Your gentle light is all.
Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
But none outshine the sight of you.
The world is spinning soft and slow,
In every breeze, in every glow.
Hold my hand, don’t let it fly—
Like a dream passing by—
Tonight, I see the truth disguised:
There are fireworks in your eyes.
If summer fades and colors dim,
I’ll close my eyes and find you then—
Beyond the crackle of the night,
You are my quiet light.
Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
But none outshine the sight of you.
Your smile flickers, warm and bright,
A guiding star in fading light.
Stay with me until sunrise,
Where new dreams will arise—
Forever, I’ll remember skies
Where I saw fireworks in your eyes.
