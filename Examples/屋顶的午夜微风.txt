We climbed the stairs to chase the fading light,
Bare feet on concrete warmed by July nights.
The city breathed beneath our little space,
Where quiet whispers softened every pace.
And in that moment, nothing felt too far—
the sky was close, holding one shy star.
風吹過我哋之間嘅沉默，
屋頂上嘅天空變得更廣闊。
心跳聲輕輕擺動，
好似等緊乜嘢會發生。
夜色沉落，影子慢慢重疊，
我哋嘅距離悄悄咁縮短。
Rooftop midnight, you and I,
緩緩的風把夜染成海。
Under the glow, under the silver sky,
我想停低，留住這一晚。
Hold this summer close and tight—
微光散落你眼底咁柔軟。
Rooftop midnight—微風帶住未講出的愛。
你笑起嚟，好似星光咁閃，
講住啲無聊故事慢慢散開。
呢座城市雖然未改變，
但你令晚風都有溫度。
遠處車聲好似搖籃曲，
陪住我哋靜靜望住天際。
Maybe someday we’ll look back and say
we didn’t know the world, but we had today.
Little pieces of the night we kept,
moments we folded and quietly wept.
And every lantern glowing in the dark—
still stays, like anchors in the heart.
Every whisper felt like a promise
we never needed to speak aloud.
屋頂夏夜暖暖的溫度，
寫低青春最靜嘅幅度。
Let the midnight breeze carry time,
讓微光一直照入未來。
Rooftop midnight, hold this light—
讓夢想跟住晚風慢慢走開。
Rooftop midnight—你係我心裡最輕最暖的光。
