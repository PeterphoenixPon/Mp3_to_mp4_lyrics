Neon stars in my reflection,
Midnight hums your recollection.
I trace your name on window glass,
A universe that couldn’t last.
Every signal fades to blue,
But my orbit’s still with you.
Constellations between us shine,
Every pulse still intertwines.
Though the distance steals the view,
The stars remember me and you.
Constellations, silent proof—
Every light still points to truth.
Echoes in electric rain,
Your laughter flickers through the pain.
We built our dreams in pixel skies,
But love was brighter than goodbyes.
If gravity pulls me through,
I’ll still fall back to you.
Out beyond the radio wave,
Your memory’s what I still crave.
If time could bend, I’d find the spark—
Your hand in the cosmic dark.
Constellations between us shine…
And you’ll always be mine.
