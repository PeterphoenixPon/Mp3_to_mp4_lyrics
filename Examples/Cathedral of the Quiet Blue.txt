Steps echo softly in the water’s glow,
Bare feet tracing ripples where sunlight falls.
The ocean sighs through broken halls,
A cathedral sleeping under waves.
Shadows dance along the pillars,
Fish glide like floating prayers.
She stands small inside the vastness—
But her heartbeat feels like a hymn.
Every breath becomes a story,
Every shimmer feels alive.
In the hush between the currents,
Something calls her name.
Here in the quiet blue,
Where time drifts slow and true,
She feels the world unfold
Like a secret kept too long.
Here where the echoes roam,
She finds a distant home—
In this forgotten place
She finally belongs.
High above, the stained glass broken,
But light pours in like falling stars.
Coral crowns the ancient arches,
Nature stitching back the scars.
She lifts her hand toward the glowing
Tiny fish that swirl around—
A choir of colors rising gently,
Turning silence into sound.
Every shimmer is a blessing,
Every moment pure and wide.
Something deep inside the stillness
Feels like being seen.
Here in the quiet blue,
Where memories flow through,
She feels her loneliness
Melt softly into peace.
Here where the currents sway,
She learns she’s allowed to stay—
In this soft blue light
Her sorrow is released.
Maybe the world above moved on,
But this place waited—
Still, patient, breathing.
Maybe she came for refuge,
But found instead
A reason to begin again.
Here in the quiet blue,
Where dreams return like dew,
She sees herself more clearly
Than she ever did before.
Here where the waters sing,
Her heart can finally bring
A steady, gentle truth:
She’s not alone anymore.
