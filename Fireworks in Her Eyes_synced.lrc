[ti:Fireworks in Her Eyes]
[ar:Peterphoenix]

[00:22.02]Summer night, the lanterns glow,
[00:25.46]I walk beside the river’s flow.
[00:28.90]Your voice drifts softly through the crowd,
[00:32.31]A quiet comfort in the loud.
[00:35.72]My heartbeat flickers like the lights,
[00:39.33]Painting memories in the night—
[00:42.94]You turn to me with shy surprise,
[00:50.11]And I see fireworks in your eyes.
[00:57.28]Colors bloom in the sky above,
[01:00.54]Like every whisper of your love—
[01:03.80]And even if the night should fade,
[01:08.21]This feeling somehow stays.
[01:12.62]Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
[01:15.85]But none outshine the sight of you.
[01:19.08]The world is spinning soft and slow,
[01:22.55]In every breeze, in every glow.
[01:26.02]Hold my hand, don’t let it fly—
[01:29.78]Like a dream passing by—
[01:33.54]Tonight, I see the truth disguised:
[01:43.31]There are fireworks in your eyes.
[01:53.08]Your yukata of summer blue,
[01:56.83]A flower dancing as you move.
[02:00.58]The pinwheel turns with every breeze,
[02:03.92]A wish carried across the trees.
[02:07.26]I brush a stray hair from your face,
[02:10.75]The moment stops, the world erased—
[02:14.24]Just you and I beneath the sky,
[02:21.38]And all the lights that burn so high.
[02:28.52]Even when the sparks all die,
[02:31.87]The warmth stays glowing in the sky—
[02:35.22]And in my heart, where shadows fall,
[02:39.68]Your gentle light is all.
[02:44.14]Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
[02:47.37]But none outshine the sight of you.
[02:50.60]The world is spinning soft and slow,
[02:54.12]In every breeze, in every glow.
[02:57.64]Hold my hand, don’t let it fly—
[03:01.64]Like a dream passing by—
[03:05.64]Tonight, I see the truth disguised:
[03:15.15]There are fireworks in your eyes.
[03:24.66]If summer fades and colors dim,
[03:28.29]I’ll close my eyes and find you then—
[03:31.92]Beyond the crackle of the night,
[03:36.06]You are my quiet light.
[03:40.20]Fireworks burst in brilliant hues,
[03:43.89]But none outshine the sight of you.
[03:47.58]Your smile flickers, warm and bright,
[03:51.07]A guiding star in fading light.
[03:54.56]Stay with me until sunrise,
[03:58.08]Where new dreams will arise—
[04:01.60]Forever, I’ll remember skies
[04:36.98]Where I saw fireworks in your eyes.
