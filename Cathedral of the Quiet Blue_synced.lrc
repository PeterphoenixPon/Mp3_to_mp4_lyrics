[ti:Cathedral of the Quiet Blue]
[ar:Peterphoenix]

[00:10.84]Steps echo softly in the water’s glow,
[00:17.52]Bare feet tracing ripples where sunlight falls.
[00:24.20]The ocean sighs through broken halls,
[00:31.10]A cathedral sleeping under waves.
[00:38.00]Shadows dance along the pillars,
[00:43.93]Fish glide like floating prayers.
[00:49.86]She stands small inside the vastness—
[00:56.36]But her heartbeat feels like a hymn.
[01:02.86]Every breath becomes a story,
[01:06.18]Every shimmer feels alive.
[01:09.50]In the hush between the currents,
[01:13.69]Something calls her name.
[01:17.88]Here in the quiet blue,
[01:21.35]Where time drifts slow and true,
[01:24.82]She feels the world unfold
[01:28.20]Like a secret kept too long.
[01:31.58]Here where the echoes roam,
[01:34.70]She finds a distant home—
[01:37.82]In this forgotten place
[01:44.04]She finally belongs.
[01:50.26]High above, the stained glass broken,
[01:56.84]But light pours in like falling stars.
[02:03.42]Coral crowns the ancient arches,
[02:09.54]Nature stitching back the scars.
[02:15.66]She lifts her hand toward the glowing
[02:22.66]Tiny fish that swirl around—
[02:29.66]A choir of colors rising gently,
[02:35.51]Turning silence into sound.
[02:41.36]Every shimmer is a blessing,
[02:44.96]Every moment pure and wide.
[02:48.56]Something deep inside the stillness
[02:53.17]Feels like being seen.
[02:57.78]Here in the quiet blue,
[03:00.85]Where memories flow through,
[03:03.92]She feels her loneliness
[03:07.31]Melt softly into peace.
[03:10.70]Here where the currents sway,
[03:13.87]She learns she’s allowed to stay—
[03:17.04]In this soft blue light
[03:23.11]Her sorrow is released.
[03:29.18]Maybe the world above moved on,
[03:34.11]But this place waited—
[03:39.04]Still, patient, breathing.
[03:43.56]Maybe she came for refuge,
[03:48.08]But found instead
[03:54.58]A reason to begin again.
[04:01.08]Here in the quiet blue,
[04:04.57]Where dreams return like dew,
[04:08.06]She sees herself more clearly
[04:11.33]Than she ever did before.
[04:14.60]Here where the waters sing,
[04:17.72]Her heart can finally bring
[04:20.84]A steady, gentle truth:
[04:50.14]She’s not alone anymore.
