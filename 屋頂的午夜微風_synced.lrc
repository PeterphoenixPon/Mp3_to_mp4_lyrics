[ti:屋頂的午夜微風]
[ar:Peterphoenixpon]

[00:13.52]We climbed the stairs to chase the fading light,
[00:19.68]Bare feet on concrete warmed by July nights.
[00:25.84]The city breathed beneath our little space,
[00:29.33]Where quiet whispers softened every pace.
[00:32.82]And in that moment, nothing felt too far—
[00:37.76]the sky was close, holding one shy star.
[00:42.69]風吹過我哋之間嘅沉默，
[00:47.62]屋頂上嘅天空變得更廣闊。
[00:52.56]心跳聲輕輕擺動，
[00:57.49]好似等緊乜嘢會發生。
[01:02.43]夜色沉落，影子慢慢重疊，
[01:07.36]我哋嘅距離悄悄咁縮短。
[01:12.30]Rooftop midnight, you and I,
[01:18.52]緩緩的風把夜染成海。
[01:24.74]Under the glow, under the silver sky,
[01:31.10]我想停低，留住這一晚。
[01:37.46]Hold this summer close and tight—
[01:43.05]微光散落你眼底咁柔軟。
[01:48.64]Rooftop midnight—微風帶住未講出的愛。
[01:55.11]你笑起嚟，好似星光咁閃，
[02:01.57]講住啲無聊故事慢慢散開。
[02:08.03]呢座城市雖然未改變，
[02:14.50]但你令晚風都有溫度。
[02:20.97]遠處車聲好似搖籃曲，
[02:27.43]陪住我哋靜靜望住天際。
[02:33.90]Maybe someday we’ll look back and say
[02:40.36]we didn’t know the world, but we had today.
[02:47.09]Little pieces of the night we kept,
[02:53.82]moments we folded and quietly wept.
[02:59.58]And every lantern glowing in the dark—
[03:05.34]still stays, like anchors in the heart.
[03:10.45]Every whisper felt like a promise
[03:15.56]we never needed to speak aloud.
[03:22.94]屋頂夏夜暖暖的溫度，
[03:30.31]寫低青春最靜嘅幅度。
[03:37.69]Let the midnight breeze carry time,
[03:45.07]讓微光一直照入未來。
[03:52.45]Rooftop midnight, hold this light—
[03:59.82]讓夢想跟住晚風慢慢走開。
[04:07.20]Rooftop midnight—你係我心裡最輕最暖的光。
